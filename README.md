# Guild Wars 2 Account Dragon

## A CLI Project

### What is the Account Dragon?
Account Dragon will let you access information from the popular videogame Guild Wars 2 about the account you've created! It's simple to use and with a fun aesthetic of chatting with a 'Data Dragon'.

### Installation Guide
- An API Key is required for the program to function. It can be generated here: https://account.arena.net/applications
    This program requires an ArenaNet account to function, which is required to create an account within the game and to play.
    This program will not save any login information or otherwise related to your account and only accepts the API Key you provide it.
    This program requires AT LEAST the account and character boxes be ticked. The rest are optional (until more functionality is added) but it's recommended to include everything.
    Once generated, you will only be required to enter the key once.
- Clone repository
- Run "ruby bin/Account_Dragon"
- Follow the instructions and have fun!

### Contributor's Guide
Pull requests are welcome. Currently, Account Dragon is capable of accessing basic information, but is easily scalable to any additional information desired. Please request any additions that modify or add on to the functionality of the program before modifying.
